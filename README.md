## What is this?

Djello is a project management tool; a single-page app powered by Angular and Rails. To start, create a 'board'. Add a 'list' to your board, and then add a 'card' to your list. When you complete a task, mark the card as completed!

## Quick start:

* Visit https://protected-basin-12361.herokuapp.com
* Login with: 'a@admin.com', 'password'
* Visit pre-populated boards, or create your own
* Play around with creating, updating, and deleting lists and cards

## Highlights:

* Single-page app
* Rails-powered API
* Angular frontend
* Cards are displayed as modals
* Edit fields in place using xeditable
