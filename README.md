##### Overview.

Djello is a project management tool that emulates Trello. On a high-level, the app allows the user to create Boards, create Lists in boards, and add Cards in Lists. The user is also able to add Members to each Board and Card, as well as see Activities involving them. On a lower-level, the app contains features such as auto-complete for searching members and modals for editing cards. The user can also re-arrange boards and lists, similar to the actual Trello.
