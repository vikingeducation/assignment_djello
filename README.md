It is a single-page project management application. It allows teams to maintain "Boards", "Lists", and "Cards", each of which represents a task that needs to be done. The app smooths the process of assigning team members to particular tasks. Sign in with email test@gmail.com or test1@gmail.com with passwords 123456, and see how adding one user as a card member, allows that user to fully participate in all the board's that the card is in actions.

## Getting Started

You can clone it and test it on your machine! You have to have the server (run `nodemon server.js` or `node server.js` inside server directory) and client side (run `npm start` inside client directory) running.
